DENTAL CLINICAL GUIDELINES - SAMPLE DOCUMENT

ACUTE PULPITIS TREATMENT

Acute pulpitis is an inflammatory condition of the dental pulp that can cause severe pain. The recommended treatment approach depends on the severity and reversibility of the condition.

For reversible pulpitis:
- Remove the cause of irritation (caries, defective restoration)
- Place a sedative dressing (calcium hydroxide or zinc oxide eugenol)
- Monitor for symptom resolution
- Consider definitive restoration once symptoms subside

For irreversible pulpitis:
- Root canal treatment is the standard of care
- Complete removal of infected pulp tissue
- Thorough cleaning and shaping of root canal system
- Obturation with gutta-percha and sealer
- Final restoration with crown or onlay

DENTAL ANXIETY MANAGEMENT

Dental anxiety affects a significant portion of the population. Management strategies include:

1. Behavioral techniques:
   - Tell-show-do approach
   - Distraction techniques
   - Progressive muscle relaxation
   - Controlled breathing exercises

2. Pharmacological management:
   - Nitrous oxide sedation (conscious sedation)
   - Oral sedation (benzodiazepines)
   - IV sedation for severe cases
   - General anesthesia as last resort

3. Environmental modifications:
   - Calm, quiet environment
   - Soothing music
   - Patient control over treatment pace
   - Clear communication throughout procedure

ROOT CANAL TREATMENT INDICATIONS

Root canal treatment is indicated in the following scenarios:

- Irreversible pulpitis with or without apical periodontitis
- Necrotic pulp with periapical pathology
- Traumatic pulp exposure
- Pulp exposure during deep caries removal
- Prior to post and core placement in endodontically treated teeth
- Teeth with persistent periapical lesions after initial treatment

Contraindications include:
- Non-restorable teeth
- Severe periodontal disease with poor prognosis
- Vertical root fractures
- Inadequate bone support

DENTAL TRAUMA IN CHILDREN

Management of dental trauma in pediatric patients requires special consideration:

Primary teeth:
- Avulsion: Do not replant; focus on space maintenance
- Intrusion: Monitor for resorption; may require extraction if severe
- Extrusion: Reposition and splint if minimal; extract if severe
- Crown fracture: Restore or extract based on extent

Permanent teeth:
- Avulsion: Immediate replantation if possible; store in appropriate medium (milk, saline, or saliva)
- Splint for 7-10 days
- Root canal treatment within 7-10 days if apex is closed
- Monitor for ankylosis and resorption

BLEEDING DISORDERS AND EXTRACTIONS

Patients with bleeding disorders require careful management:

Pre-operative assessment:
- Complete medical history
- Coagulation studies if indicated
- Consultation with hematologist if severe disorder
- Consider factor replacement or desmopressin if needed

Intra-operative:
- Use local hemostatic agents (surgical, gelfoam, thrombin)
- Minimize trauma
- Ensure primary closure
- Consider sutures for hemostasis

Post-operative:
- Avoid NSAIDs
- Monitor for excessive bleeding
- Provide clear post-operative instructions
- Emergency contact information

ORAL HYGIENE INSTRUCTION

Effective oral hygiene instruction should be personalized and include:

1. Brushing technique:
   - Use soft-bristled toothbrush
   - Brush twice daily for 2 minutes
   - Use fluoride toothpaste
   - Angle brush 45 degrees to gumline
   - Gentle circular motions

2. Flossing:
   - Daily flossing is essential
   - Proper technique: C-shape around each tooth
   - Use 18 inches of floss
   - Clean both sides of each tooth

3. Additional aids:
   - Interdental brushes for larger spaces
   - Water flossers as adjunct
   - Antimicrobial mouth rinses if indicated
   - Tongue cleaning

4. Dietary considerations:
   - Limit sugary and acidic foods
   - Avoid frequent snacking
   - Drink water after meals
   - Consider xylitol products
